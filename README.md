  Sidekiq + Redis (Background Jobs)
  


**Setup Instructions**

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

  Ruby 2.7.6
  
  Rails 7.x
  
  PostgreSQL
  
  Redis (for Sidekiq)

3. Configure Database

  Update config/database.yml with your PostgreSQL credentials if needed.
  Then, create and migrate the database:

  rails db:migrate


5. Start the Server

**Authentication & User Roles**

User Types:

  Event Organizers can create, update, and manage events.
  
  Customers can browse events and book tickets.

Login & Authentication

  Authentication is handled via JWT tokens.
  
  To register or log in, use the Devise JWT endpoints:

  On successful login, youâ€™ll receive a JWT token. Include this token in requests:
  
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
